# Virtank

Virtank is an simulator for [Quanser's Coupled Tanks](https://www.quanser.com/products/coupled-tanks/). It was developed for remotely tune and test control strategies without the real system. It has the same connection interface for the real system which makes easy to use the simulator without any modification in the control software.
